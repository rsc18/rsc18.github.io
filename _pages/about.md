I'm a PhD student in Computer Science at Florida State University, where my research focuses on high-speed interconnects for HPC and AI/ML workloads. 
My work explores how software-defined networking (SDN) and local router intelligence can improve routing efficiency and mitigate congestion in large-scale systems.
My research interests includes Network Interconnect, Adaptive Routing, Communication Optimization and MPI. 

I am honored to be advised by Professor [Xin Yuan](https://www.cs.fsu.edu/~xyuan). I completed my undergraduate from Tribhuvan University, Nepal where my undergraduate research advisor was Professor [Subarna Shakya](http://doece.pcampus.edu.np/index.php/prof-dr-subarna-shakya/).
You can see my publications in the `publication` tab or at [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MfhWZakAAAAJ&hl=en) for my most recent publications.

Key highlights of my research include:

‚úÖ Developing SDN-based adaptive routing strategies for Dragonfly topologies

‚úÖ Enhancing UGAL routing with accurate local latency estimation

‚úÖ Applying deep learning for congestion-aware routing, matching and outperforming traditional adaptive schemes

I‚Äôve contributed to simulators like Booksim, CODES, and SST, and my work has been published at venues like SC, ICS, and CCGRID.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Tech: Python, C/C++, MPI, CUDA, OpenMP, PyTorch, TensorFlow, SDN, SST, CODES, Booksim
I‚Äôm excited about pushing the limits of interconnect design for the next generation of AI and HPC systems. 

<!-- The theme of my research is **system for machine learning and machine learning for system**.   -->

I enjoy Soccer, Basketball, Chess, and Traveling during my free time.
