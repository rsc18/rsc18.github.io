title: "Achieving the performance of global adaptive routing using local information on dragonfly through deep learning"
excerpt: "<br/> The Universal Globally Adaptive Load-balance
Routing (UGAL) with global information, referred as UGALG, represents an ideal form of adaptive routing on Dragonfly.
However, UGAL-G is impractical to implement since the global
information cannot be maintained accurately. Practical adaptive
routing schemes, such as UGAL with local information (UGALL), performs noticeably worse than UGAL-G. In this work, we
investigate a machine learning approach for routing on Dragonfly.
Specifically, we develop a machine learning based routing scheme,
called UGAL-ML, that is capable of making routing decisions
like UGAL-G based only on the information local to each router.
Our preliminary evaluation indicates that UGAL-ML can achieve
comparable performance to UGAL-G for some traffic patterns.
