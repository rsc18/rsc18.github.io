title: "Exploring Software-Defined Networking for Routing in Dragonfly Topology"
excerpt: "<br/> While the efficient routing in Dragonfly networks present significant challenges, the advent of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) offers new opportunities for network management and routing optimization by providing a global network view. This research proposes an SDN-based adaptive routing approach for Dragonfly interconnects. By leveraging global traffic pattern information from SDN, the approach identifies and avoids persistent congestion points, leading to improved resource utilization and enhanced performance. This study addresses a critical gap in developing efficient adaptive routing solutions using SDN technology, aiming to optimize routing decisions and overall network efficiency.
